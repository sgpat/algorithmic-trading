    "## Introduction & Library Imports\n",
    "The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section of the course is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Library Imports\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is import the open-source software libraries that we'll be using in this tutorial."
